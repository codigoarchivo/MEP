I introduce myself, I am Edgar my mission is designed to be used in the process of investigation, liberation, and transformation of the energies generated by each person and that are based on the foundations of the laws that govern all creation in terrestrial life. Those universal principles are the 7 Hermetic principles, well known to spiritual disciplines. Thanks to the level of consciousness of humanity and its evolution in the management of its energies, we have been detected that there is a law that protects us and elevates us to a higher level of evolution, that law is unconditional love. This principal uses all the others as experiential patterns of understanding the creations on this plane. This method has the higher purpose of raising awareness and connecting with those who practice it. Through understanding, people take responsibility for their creations, understanding the energetic pattern they must change. Through the use of the pendulum as a vehicle of connection with divinity, it is possible to connect with the information necessary for its understanding and consequent liberation and transformation of energy models and patterns inappropriate for its present moment and brings to its consciousness information necessary for its advancement and development. . Aspects of your emotional memory with which you are tuned in and that could be generating blockages in different areas of your life. This method reprograms and transforms the genealogy of the soul, family and individual karma into current ancestral memories of the mental, emotional, physical and spiritual body in all dimensions of being.",
